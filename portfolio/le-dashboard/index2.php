                            <p>Localedge's customer dashboard design was severly out of date, in 2014. My job was to take an old design and modernize the interface and the user experience up to modern standards. Key pieces to my design concept were a side navigation to access an excessive list of internal links, tabbed individual reporting navigation for each application element, and an overall clean and consistant look and feel. The image above is just a basic example of what most of the reporting pages look like. </p>

                            <p>With the redesign of the new Localedge customer dashboard, I felt there needed to be a new standards site of set design rules. This is still a work in progress. This site has been a true learning experience in my development as a UX/UI Designer as I was able to take ownership over ensuring these rules are followed and are communicated well to Product Owners and Developers. Setting design rules for a large application has been both challenging and rewarding. </p>
